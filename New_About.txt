					<h1>About</h1>
					<h2>Welcome to</h2>
                                                                                            <h1>Academic Affairs</h2>
					<p>An online learning platform for UG students. It helps the students to not only excel in their academics but also helps in gaining and understanding the technical skills used in the current working industry.
You may think that we are using cartoon characters to explain the concepts to UG students. But from a number of surveys we found that, no matter what the age is, humans always stay focused when a cartoon character or any image is running on the screen.

This way of learning reduces the effort and stress by half compared to reading textbooks and notes. Here our main aim is to bring the concepts to life So that you can understand and remember the concepts better.</p>

				     <p>To overcome all the problems of studying, we started to do research on how to actually learn the concepts.

After going through a number of expert analyses and researches, we got to the conclusion that Learning the concepts and presenting them in the exam are two different things. There are few ways to learn the concepts and present them in a better way.
Let us discuss one of them.

First of all while reading a concept we need to relate the concept to one of our daily life activities, to briefly understand the working of the concept. This way of learning helps the students to remember the concepts for a longer time.

Then we need to know how, and where it is implemented in real-life, that is in industries, companies, etc to completely understand the concept.</p>

<p>For making these steps easier for the students we are providing Video explanations of the concepts along with their implementation. And also provide notes that mainly focus on the presentation of the concepts in the exams.

In the video lectures, we explained the concepts, just the way we discussed earlier. We will be explaining the concepts just like your friend does. You will be able to understand the concepts, remember them, and present them in a better way with the help of the notes we provide you.
We not only concentrate on academics but also help students in boosting their knowledge in the current industry. For that we provide
